# R_Study_Group_Demo
Demo repository for the R Study Group


**Ideas for future meetings**
- Rmarkdown and/or Quarto (reporting, reproducible research)
- Openscapes (reproducible research)
- commands in the terminal (communicating with github beyond what can be done in RStudio GUI)
- creating custom functions in R
- creating packages in R?
- creating Shiny apps for user-friendly data exploration or visualization?

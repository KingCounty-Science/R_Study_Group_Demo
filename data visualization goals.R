## Read in data (Hydrology_UKEZC, in "data" folder of this project)


## Visualize daily discharge over time from 2001-2003, coloring the values which are "E" (estimated) vs those with no flags


## Visualize water temperature for 2022-2023 on a shared x-axis spanning the first to last day of the year
